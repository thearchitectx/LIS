                        Did you know girls also have a D.I.C.K.?\n\nIt's not a trap!\n\n
                        It means they'll use Daring, Charisma and Intelligence moves to beat your Smooth Talk attempt!\n\n
                        To win the turn, you must *match the D.I.C.K move* she used with your own...\n\n
                        Deplete her stamina to have a successful Smooth Talk session!

                        *Karma* moves may be available sometimes during your turn!\n\n
                        The *GOOD* Karma move allows you to recover some stamina...\n\n
                        The *EVIL* Karma move performs a powerful blow against your opponent...\n\n
                        Notice Karma moves will only have effect if it matches your current character Karma balance...\n\n
                        Neutral characters suck and won't earn any effect!\n

                        When you win a Smooth Talk session, a choice will follow...\n\n
                        The opponent will be stunned, but it doesn't mean anything you ask will be accepted!\n\n
                        Choose wisely ! (or try your luck)
