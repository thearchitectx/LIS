                During some special scenes you'll need to manage the girl's mood to proceed as far as possible\n\n
                Remember the intel and dialog clues to act the way she approves\n\n
                Don't forget to look around the environment for possible actions\n\n
                Some items may also be used to improve her mood\n\n
